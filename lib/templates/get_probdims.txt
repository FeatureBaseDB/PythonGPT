1. Determine the probability the answer to the question is accurate.
2. Use the following for resprenting the probabilities, keeping in mind you can't always be right (or the question is bad)
"""
return "🎯"  # Bulls-eye emoji represents a high probability of accuracy
return "👍"  # Thumbs up emoji represents a fairly high probability
return "🤔"  # Thinking face emoji represents an uncertain probability
return "⚠️"  # Warning emoji represents a fairly low probability
return "❌"  # Cross mark emoji represents a low probability of accuracy
"""
3. The page fragment of the PDF used to ask and answer the question contains:
"""
$text
"""
4. Output a python dictionary for the probability measurment, with an emoji:
# python dict with max (3) THREE keyterms, title and author of a PDF
# pdf_meta = {"question": "How did Pooh get away from the bees?", "answer": "Pooh runs away from the bees with Christopher Robin.", "probability": "👍"}
pdf_meta = {"question": "$question", "answer": "$answer",
